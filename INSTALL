Thanks for downloading django-mailinglist-registration.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``mailinglist_registration`` directory somewhere on your Python path,
or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python path; this is useful
if you're working from a Mercurial checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.5 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.4 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
