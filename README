========================
Django mailinglist registration
========================

This code was originally "a fairly simple user-registration
application for Django, designed to make allowing user signups as
painless as possible" before I started messing around with it to
suit my needs.

It requires a functional installation of Django 1.4 or newer, but
has no other dependencies.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "quickstart.rst" in the "docs/"
directory.
